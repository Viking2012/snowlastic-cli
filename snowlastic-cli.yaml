# Note:
# Instead of defining any of the below variables, any of the keys below
# may be created and read from an environment variable. This is especially
# useful when storing credentials such as usernames or passwords.
# i.e. instead of changing the "elasticPassword" setting below, you may
# create an environment variable with the same name and containing the
# appropriate value. When using environment variables, you should remove
# or comment out the entry in this file to remove the potential for conflicts.

# The elasticIndices should contain a list of all indices which are/will be
# present in the elasticsearch platform. Each entry in elasticIndices should be
# in the following format:
# index_name:
#   path_to_query: "path/to/location/of/query.sql
#   path_to_index_settings: "path/to/location/of/settings.json"

# In the above format, 'index_name' should be in snake_case and will become
# the name of the index created in the elasticsearch platform. Several examples
# for Navex Cases, SAP transactions, SAP master records, and documents from
# SalesForce are provided as standard examples below.

# The path_to_index_settings variable should point to a JSON file containing
# an explicit elasticsearch mapping. These can be reused, but should be complete
# settings files (not just a partial list of properties/fields) - in other words
# it should include normalizers, analyzers, and mappings. The current layout of
# of these settings considers that there are three major types of documents which
# are expected to be contained within the database: transactions, master data records,
# and operational documents (i.e. "miscellaneous" documents). Feel free to create your
# own mappings files, but note that keeping field names and type consistent with
# the current layout is advised.

# The path_to_query variable should point to a SQL file which would be used to
# collect records for the index. These queries should return all fields used in
# the related mapping for the index, using NULL values where necessary. Note that
# names of the return fields should be in snake_case and match exactly those fields
# which are present in the related mapping. There most also be at least one additional
# field included in each query which is not mapped in the settings file: "id". This
# field must uniquely identify each record. Finally, this query is generally "wrapped"
# when used internally (usually in a CTE) to facilitate filtering and collection of
# import progression metadata - please keep this in mind when generating new queries.
